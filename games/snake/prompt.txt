Write a standalone HTML file that implements the classic Snake game using only plain JavaScript and the HTML5 <canvas> element. The page should:

1. Create a square canvas (e.g. 400×400px) centered on the page.
2. Draw the snake as a series of filled blocks that moves by 1 block per “tick.”
3. Use the arrow keys to control the snake’s direction (no reverse on a single press).
4. Randomly place a “fruit” block on the grid; when the snake’s head reaches it:
   - Play the sound “crunch.mp3” (located at src="../crunch.mp3")
   - Grow the snake by one block
   - Increment and display the score in the top corner
5. Detect collisions with walls or the snake’s own body:
   - Stop the game loop
   - Play the sound “gameover.mp3” (located at src="../gameover.mp3")
   - Display “Game Over” and the final score
6. Preload and play both audio files using the Audio API:
   const eatSound = new Audio('../crunch.mp3');
   const dieSound = new Audio('../gameover.mp3');
7. Keep styling minimal (inline CSS is fine) and include all code in one HTML file.
8. At the end, ensure the code is copy‑paste‑ready: one .html file that “just works” when opened in a browser.
